After being in the sales field for many years, I was glad to receive new information, techniques and statistics from the seminar. It was also delightful to have things I already knew presented in a new and interesting way. The seminar has also helped me put back a bit of structure to my sales and sales management approach. My communication with the sales team has improved because to a large extent we are now on the same page using the seminar as a reference to some discussions.

I am glad I brought a big part of my sales team to attend and at least this training has helped trigger more sales-like thinking in the department.

The fact that the facilitator was interactive and used a lot of real life, practical examples was very useful. You also got the feeling that the facilitator has been in the ‘trenches’ so to speak doing real sales and was sharing from a point of knowledge and experience as opposed to text book theory.</i></p>

The idea of picking on a specific selling tactic was just the best part of the programme. I learnt a lot on prospecting, relationship building by not wasting lunch, the golden hour for selling, personalized communication and dealing with objections without hurting clients. The content of the programme was comprehensive, presented in the simplest and easy to understand format. God bless all of you at ISTI who took time to put together such a great seminar.</i></p>

The bit on customer classification was especially important for me. Many are times when we have treated all customers the same way yet they are so different.<br/>

The need to know the people we are dealing with is also important. For upcoming sales people and mangers, this will come in handy as it will help save time and achieve desired results fast. For example one could be spending all his time dealing with a finance manager yet the buying decision is made by a purchasing officer.<br/>

Already, I’ve incorporated much of what I learned to my selling tactics.</i></p>
